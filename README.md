### Pratham here; welcome.

You might be surprised to learn that there isn't a nice, attractive readme over here. Designing is not my strong suit, therefore I don't want to waste my time trying. I'm intending to significantly influence the web development industry not designing.

In any case, I write JavaScript, CSS, and React but not every day since I like influencing the community and supporting developers.

I built a strong and huge developer community on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/prathkum). You should follow me I believe.

Exploring web3 nowadays!

P.S. If you love desinging, feel free to open a PR and build a fancy readme for me [here](https://github.com/PrathamKumar14/PrathamKumar14/).
